# Headline-Generation
This project focuses on generating news headlines from article text using a Seq2Seq Encoder-Decoder model with an Attention Mechanism. Additionally, the project involves fine-tuning the T5 model for headline generation. The goal is to create concise, accurate, and contextually relevant headlines that capture the essence of the news articles.
